    Last weekend many of you were probably  Instagramming your last toes-in-the-sand beach selfie or picnic in the park selfie of the summer. You’re feeling bittersweet. Or maybe just bitter.

From here on out, daylight will shrink to almost    nothing as we battle icy winds on our way to and from work every day .  Can  you hear the wolves howling outside your door?
