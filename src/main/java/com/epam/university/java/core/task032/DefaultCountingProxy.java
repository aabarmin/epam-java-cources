    * Processes a method invocation on a proxy instance and returns
    * the result.  This method will be invoked on an invocation handler
    * when a method is invoked on a proxy instance that it is
    * associated with.
    *
    * @param proxy  the proxy instance that the method was invoked on
    * @param method the {@code Method} instance corresponding to
    *               the interface method invoked on the proxy instance.  The declaring
    *               class of the {@code Method} object will be the interface that
    *               the method was declared in, which may be a superinterface of the
    *               proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.
    * @param args   an array of objects containing the values of the
    *               arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxy instance,
    *               or {@code null} if interface method takes no arguments.
    *               Arguments of primitive types are wrapped in instances of the
    *               appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as
    *               {@code java.lang.Integer} or {@code java.lang.Boolean}.
    * @return the value to return from the method invocation on the
    *         proxy instance.  If the declared return type of the interface
    *         method is a primitive type, then the value returned by
    *         this method must be an instance of the corresponding primitive
    *         wrapper class; otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the
    *         declared return type.  If the value returned by this method is
    *         {@code null} and the interface method's return type is
    *         primitive, then a {@code NullPointerException} will be
    *         thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.  If the
    *         value returned by this method is otherwise not compatible with
    *         the interface method's declared return type as described above,
    *         a {@code ClassCastException} will be thrown by the method
    *         invocation on the proxy instance.
    * @throws Throwable the exception to throw from the method
    *                   invocation on the proxy instance.  The exception's type must be
    *                   assignable either to any of the exception types declared in the
    *                   {@code throws} clause of the interface method or to the
    *                   unchecked exception types {@code java.lang.RuntimeException}
    *                   or {@code java.lang.Error}.  If a checked exception is
    *                   thrown by this method that is not assignable to any of the
    *                   exception types declared in the {@code throws} clause of
    *                   the interface method, then an
    *                   {@link UndeclaredThrowableException} containing the
    *                   exception that was thrown by this method will be thrown by the
    *                   method invocation on the proxy instance.
